# demedify
The goal of demedify is to demystify medical terms by expanding acronyms and clarifying jargon. 

For a time, it was active as a reddit bot on r/medicine as [u/demedify](https://www.reddit.com/user/demedify/). This was started as a way to make r/medicine more inclusive for [foreign docs](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6d5fq1/rmedicine_is_not_a_welcoming_sub_for_foreign/di0789a/) and lay people. 

If there's a term that you think should or should not be included, please make a pull request with the updated/new list or submit it as an issue. 

Inspiration and thanks to the [praw package](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [u/Decronym](http://decronym.xyz/), a similar Reddit bot.
